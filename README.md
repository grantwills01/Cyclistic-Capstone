Cyclistic Data Analysis Project - 
Grant Wills

This project is about analyzing raw data of fictional bikeshare company Cyclistic. 
The data used is real bikeshare data made publicly available by Motivate International Inc [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

Please first open the Cyclistic 12 Month Report .pdf file. 
For a closer look at my SQL statements I used for cleaning and analysis, please open the .sql scripts I provided.
